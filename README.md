# Exercises
We strongly believe in working in groups so, if possible, it would help your learning experience to find a partner to work with (you can do this remotely too!).

At FAC, we also encourage learning through your own research.

## Command Line, Git, Github

### Topics to research
**You will not get very far without knowing how to...**
* Navigate your file system with the following commands:
  * ``cd`` & ``cd ..``
  * ``mkdir`` & ``touch``
  *  ``ls`` & ``ls -a``
  *  ``rm``
  *  ``mv``
  *  ``cp``

* Starting a git project on git / github. In a project this will typically happen by:
  * Creating a repo on Github, initializing it with a readme, cloning it to a local folder
  * Navigating online to an existing Github repo and clone it to a local folder

You could find it convenient to **learn shortcuts and convenient commands** such as
  * ``&&``
  * aliases on your bash profile

...and know what a **gitignore** is and why it is useful.

## HTML5 / CSS
### Topics to research
**You will not get very far without knowing about/how to...**
* Create an html document (this is very easy with Atom's autocomplete!)
* Give **classes** and **id**'s to **divs**
* **Input** fields and **forms**
* **Buttons**
* CSS selectors (how to target the correct one)

### Practice
* Make your own grid system (without bootstrap).
* Look through the animations [here](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp) and Build something that inspires you with a cool transition!

## JS
### Topics to research
**You will not get very far without knowing...**
* Array methods such as ``map``, ``reduce``, ``forEach``, ``filter``
* ``document.getElementById``, ``addEventListener``
* How to **change classes dynamically**

### Practice
* [Codewars](http://www.codewars.com), which allows great practice with functions, arrays, and objects, but little/none on DOM manipulation.
* You should practice DOM manipulation with a..

## Project from home
* Create a simple webpage about you and your experience in learning programming and web development so far. **No frameworks** (e.g. jQuery, Bootstrap, etc.). You could, for example, include:
  * About section
  * Contact section
  * Navbar (e.g. links between About section and Contact section)


If you run out of things to do, contact [Sam](https://github.com/shouston3) or [Franz](https://github.com/franzmoro) on Gitter.'`

# Tools to setup for precourse
We will have an **installation party on June 2, 2016**, where you will get plenty of support installing the necessary tools. You will however need a text editor to get through the precourse exercises.

### Text Editor
We strongly recommend to use **[Atom](https://atom.io/)**. It's open source, has plenty of features and add-on packages.

### Setup tips (incl. Git, Command Line, Github)
By now you should have already used git, github and your command line. Go through [this readme](https://github.com/dwyl/dev-setup) for a few setup tips on them and on  Atom.
